                   <p> Wrap the base of a loose-bottomed, 20cm non-stick cake tin with cling film,
                   twizzling it into a knot on the underside, then slot base back in the tin.
                   Cut the salmon into pieces about 15cm long and make a neat layer of slices,
                   presentation side down, on the base of the tin. Start at the outside and push
                   the slices right to the edge; after going all round the edge, fill in the centre
                   with straight pieces of salmon.
               </p>

                    Mash the cream cheese until smooth (a rubber spatula is good for this), working
                   in the mignonette pepper and a pinch of salt at the same time. Pour in two-thirds
                   of the cream, a little at a time, and keep stirring and beating until a smooth,
                   lightly whipped cream consistency is achieved. Now work in the lemon juice.
                   If slightly too firm (it should be spreadable), work in the remaining cream and
                   then recheck for seasoning.

                   <p> Soak 12 wooden skewers in water for 30 mins (this helps to stop them burning).
                       In a large bowl, mix together the tikka paste with half of the yogurt, the cumin,
                       ginger and seasoning. Boil the potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water for 7 mins,
                       then drain well and tip into the tikka mixture with the paneer. Gently mix into the
                       marinade, then chill for at least 2 hrs to take on flavour.</p>
                   <p> To assemble the kebabs, alternately thread the marinated potatoes and paneer onto
                       the skewers with the onions and peppers, then cover on a tray until you are ready
                       to barbecue.


               </p>
               <p>
                    Heat the barbecue or a grill. Mix the mango chutney into the remaining yogurt, and
                   the mint leaves into the salad leaves. Barbecue or grill the kebabs for 10-15 mins,
                   turning, until the veg are charred and softened. With a few minutes to go, add the
                   chapattis to the barbecue in batches to warm through. Serve the kebabs with the
                   minty salad, cooling mango yogurt and chapattis, and let everyone assemble their
                   own wraps.
